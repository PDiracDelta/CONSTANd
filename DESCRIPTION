Missing information needs to
be presented as nan values and not as zero values, because CONSTANd is able to ignore
nan-values when calculating the mean. The variable <maxIterations> is an
integer value that denotes the number of raking cycles. The variable <precision>
defines the stopping criteria based on the L1-norm as defined by
Friedrich Pukelsheim, Bruno Simeone in "On the Iterative Proportional
Fitting Procedure: Structure of Accumulation Points and L1-Error
